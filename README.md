# Project
This is the shared repository used for project in Data Processing in Python course at the Institute of Economic Studies (IES) at Faculty of Social Sciences, Charles University. The main goal of this project is stock market data analysis. 
To be more precise, we will download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance and moreover, accounting and financial measures from Macrotrends using web scraping. 
The most important outcome of this project for an outsider viewer is probably the web app which combines all the aspects of our work - it includes data download, data display, graphical visualisation and stockÂ´s future value prediction. Nevertheless, the web app provides just the outcomes and final outputs. In case you would like to see in detail what steps we took - how we work with data, what prediction techniques we use and how we apply them - or you would be interested in replicating our work, we include the ipynb files with the code, comments and explanations. These files could be also handy if you are not able to launch the web app. If that is the case, you do not have to be disappointed. The files provided will lead you through what was consecutively supposed to happen, even though it might be less "smooth" than scrolling though the web app.

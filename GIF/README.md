Here you can see what the web app should look like in your browser using streamlit. 

After data are uploaded, user can choose tickers from S&P 500 market index based on his preferences.

After checking the validity of selected tickers, user can see financial data.

Then, user can select whether he want to see data for all selected tickers. Or whether he want to see ratios only for one from selected tickers (this option is included for time efficiency - user does not have to look for tickers among 500 tickers), or whether he want to see ratios for any ticker from S&P 500 market index.

Finally, the user will be presented with predictions for tickers seleted at the beginning of the web app. And at the end, user can download financial data from Yahoo Finance for all tickers which were transformed into csv format.
